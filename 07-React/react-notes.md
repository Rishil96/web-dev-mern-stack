## Introduction & Components

- **React** is a frontend framework that allows us to build frontend based applications with ease.

- Thinking in React: think about your final product as an application and then break the UI into a component hierarchy 

- create a react project using `npm create vite@latest` and select configurations.

- it will generate some starter files in our project folder, index.html and main.jsx hooks each other up.

- everything inside your application is rendered inside div with class root that is in our index file

- a function inside of react as long it starts with a capital letter is a **Component**. When we return jsx from a function starting with capital letter, it is a component.

- a react component/function can only return one JSX/HTML element.
